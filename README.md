### Hey there! 

I'm learning full-stack web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. 

📚 I'm currently learning basic Ruby syntax and creating some elementary programs for coursework. 
🍻 My day job is running a small dive bar in a college town in Alabama 🐯 but have a broad work-experience including non-profits, for-profits, and startups. 
🤝 I'd love to collaborate on projects involving dashboards for small businesses and simple, efficient web-based tools for interesting niches. 

📫 You can find me on Twitter, or LinkedIn, or on my <a href="https://www.chrisclevenger.com/">personal website</a>.
