### Hey there! 

I'm learning full-stack web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>. 

📚 I'm currently learning basic Ruby syntax and creating some elementary programs for coursework. <br>
🍻 My day job is running a small dive bar in a college town in Alabama 🐯. <br>
🦺  I have a broad work-experience including non-profits, for-profits, and startups. <br>
🤝 I'd love to collaborate on projects involving dashboards for small businesses or web-based tools for interesting niches. <br>
📫 You can find me on Twitter, or LinkedIn, or on my <a href="https://www.chrisclevenger.com/">personal website</a>.
